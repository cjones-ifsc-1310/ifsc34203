                                                      <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
                                                          <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
                                                              <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
                                                                  <h3>Questions</h3>
                                                                      <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
                                                                          <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute.</h4>
                                                                              <p>The alt attribute is typically utilized for photos, to describe an image for those who may be visually impaired. The title attribute is used more as a screen tooltip, possibly offering more information.</p>
                                                                                  <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
